        The local-to-global property for Morse quasi-geodesics<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        We show the mapping class group, CAT(0) groups, the fundamental groups of compact 3-manifolds, and certain relatively hyperbolic groups have a local-to-global property for Morse quasi-geodesics. As a consequence, we generalize combination theorems of Gitik for quasiconvex subgroups of hyperbolic groups to the stable subgroups of these groups.  In the case of the mapping class group, this gives a combination theorem for convex cocompact subgroups. This is a joint work with Jacob Russell and Davide Spriano.<br>

        The higher topological complexity of the complement of fiber type arrangements and related topics<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        In the talk we present our method to compute the higher topological complexity of the complement of fiber type arrangements. The same method will be applied to compute the higher topological complexity for some other spaces.<br>

        Hierarchically hyperbolic groups: An introduction<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        Hierarchical hyperbolicity provides a uniform framework for working with many important examples, including mapping class groups, right angled Artin groups, Teichmuller space, and others.  In this talk I'll provide an introduction to studying groups and spaces from this point of view. This talk will include joint work with M. Hagen and A. Sisto.<br>

        Ribbon homology cobordisms<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        A cobordism between 3-manifolds is ribbon if it has no 3-handles. Such cobordisms arise naturally from several different topological and geometric contexts. In this talk, we describe a few obstructions to their existence, from Thurston geometries, character varieties, and instanton and Heegaard Floer homologies, and some applications. This is joint work with Aliakbar Daemi, Tye Lidman, and Shea Vela-Vick.<br>

        Mixed Hodge structures on Alexander modules<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        Given an epimorphism from the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety U onto the integers Z, one naturally obtains an infinite cyclic cover of the variety. In analogy with knot theory, the homology groups of this infinite cyclic cover, which are endowed with Z-actions by deck transformations, determine the family of Alexander modules associated to the epimorphism. In this talk, we will talk about how to equip the torsion part of the Alexander modules (with respect to the Z-actions) with canonical mixed Hodge structures in the case when the epimorphism is the induced map on fundamental groups of an algebraic map f from U into the punctured complex plane. Furthermore, we will compare the resulting mixed Hodge structure to other well studied mixed Hodge structures in the literature, including the limit mixed Hodge structure on the generic fiber of f. The relevant concepts will be introduced during the talk. Joint work with C. Geske, L. Maxim, and B. Wang.<br>

        Decomposing sutured instanton Floer homology<br><br>
        <span class="label">Abstract</span>
        Sutured instanton Floer homology was introduced by Kronheimer and Mrowka. In this talk I will explain how to decompose sutured instanton Floer homology with respect to a properly embedded surface inside the sutured manifold, and explain how this decomposition could be used to study the topological complexities of sutured manifolds and taut foliations. This work is partially joint with Sudipta Ghosh.<br>
