        <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong. For the last two years of my secondary education, I attended <a href="https://www.uwcad.it/">United World College of the Adriatic</a>, a school in Duino, Italy that is a part of a global education movement that brings together students from around the world with the aim to foster peace and international understanding.</p> 

        <p>I received my bachelor's degree from Princeton University in June 2012. When I graduated, I wrote <a href="http://blogs.princeton.edu/mathclub/guide/courses/topology/">an introduction to topology</a>, which formed a part of the guide for mathematics majors, for the Princeton University Mathematics Club.</p>

        <p>I received my Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in May 2017, under the supervision of <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~petero/">Peter S. Ozsv&aacute;th</a> and <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/lipshitz">Robert Lipshitz.</a> My dissertation concerns the unoriented skein relations in knot Floer homology and tangle Floer homology.</p>

        <p>After my doctorate, I worked with <a href="http://vela-vick.com/">David Shea Vela-Vick</a> at Louisiana State University from 2017 to 2020, and in Fall 2022. From 2020 to 2022, I worked with <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~ina/">Ina Petkova</a> at Dartmouth College.</p>

        <p>Since January 2023, I have been at the University of Ottawa. While I continue to work on fleshing out the theoretical aspects of Floer invariants for 3-manifolds, knots, links, tangles, and their cobordisms, my research also concerns the applications of these invariants to Legendrian and transverse knots, as well as cobordisms between them, in the context of contact geometry. I also work on exploring Floer theory in the context of categorification.</p>

        <p>While I was at Princeton, my main extra-curricular activity was the <a href="https://princetongleeclub.com/">Princeton University Glee Club</a> (the university concert choir), in which I sang as a baritone.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy photography, playing bridge (which <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/phlee/">my bridge partner and former suitemate</a> taught me), and playing soccer and table tennis. I am also very interested in the studies of Classical Chinese and Classical Japanese text.</p>
